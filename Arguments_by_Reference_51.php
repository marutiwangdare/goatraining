Passing Arguments by Reference
In PHP, arguments are usually passed by value, 
which means that a copy of the value is used in the function and 
the variable that was passed into the function cannot be changed.

When a function argument is passed by reference, 
    changes to the argument also change the variable that was passed in. 
    To turn a function argument into a reference, the & operator is used:

Example
Use a pass-by-reference argument to update a variable:

-->
<?php
function add_five(&$value) {
  $value += 5;
}

$num = 2;

add_five($num);

echo $num;
?>
