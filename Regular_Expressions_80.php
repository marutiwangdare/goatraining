    What is a Regular Expression?
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. When you search for data in a text,
 you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.

A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.

Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.

Syntax
In PHP, regular expressions are strings composed of delimiters, a pattern and optional modifiers.

$exp = "/w3schools/i";
In the example above, / is the delimiter, w3schools is the pattern that is being searched for, 
and i is a modifier that makes the search case-insensitive.

The delimiter can be any character that is not a letter, number, backslash or space. 
The most common delimiter is the forward slash (/), 
but when your pattern contains forward slashes it is convenient to choose other delimiters such as # or ~.
