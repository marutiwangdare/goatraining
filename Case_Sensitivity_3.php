PHP Case Sensitivity
In PHP, keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, 
and user-defined functions are not case-sensitive.

In the example below, all three echo statements below are equal and legal:

-->

<?php

ECHO "Hello World!<br>";
echo "Hello World!<br>";
EcHo "Hello World!<br>";

?>
